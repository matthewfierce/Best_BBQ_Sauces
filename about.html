      <h1>About Our Company</h1>
      <p>In 1952 our grandfather had one mission and one mission only and that was to make a BBQ sauce that will be the best in the country.This was our grandfathers goal in life and strived to be the leading competitior in the BBQ sauce world.</p>

	<p>He spent countless hours working on a BBQ that was unique and like no other style of BBQ in America at the time. He wanted to revolutionize on how BBQ woud not only taste but how it was uniquely made. Around 1954 our grandfather finally had created a recipe that was unique to other BBQ sauces and was finally satisfied with his own product. After countless years of trying Dad's BBQ was finally made and put into action.</p>

	<P> Without the countless hours our grandfather put in we would not be able to have this company today. With all our countless hours of help he are able to spread his love of cooking home style BBQ with the people of this country. Our goal is to share the same dream our grandfather had and continue making a BBQ sauce that can still be used generation to generation, and still make a quality product that people will still continue to love in there homes and in resturaunts.</P>
